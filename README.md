<h1>This is Web UI automation framework for demoqa.com </h1>
<p>I am in no way affiliated with the site owners and have not taken their courses or anything else, the framework is designed purely for practice purposes. For my part, I will note that the site has a lot of different functionality like alerts, tooltips, buttons, forms, links, draggable and many other things that you can try to automate. </p>>
